# niolabs UI Toolkit

nbiolabs-themed ReactStrap and Victory Charts components implemented in React and leveraging CSS Modules!

## Installation

```
npm install --save @nio/ui-kit
```

Each component uses locally scoped CSS by requiring the subset of the imported library stylesheets it needs, with additional theming performed inside each component's _styles.scss file.

To change the theme to match your brand colors, fork the repo and override the values in the src/_theme.scss.
