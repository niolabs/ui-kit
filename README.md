# niolabs UI Toolkit

nbiolabs-themed Foundation Sites components implemented in React and compatible with CSS Modules!

## Installation

```
npm install --save react-nuik-playground
```

Each component uses locally scoped CSS by requiring the subset of the Foundation stylesheets it needs.

If you want to use CSS modules and customize Foundation at the same time, look at /examples/css-modules-themed which uses https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsontosass-loader to inject sass variables that override Foundation's default settings.
